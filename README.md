## Overview

AgentCodeGUI is a Windows app that brings the terminal coding agents (**Claude Code** · **Codex CLI**) into a single desktop app. Give it work by chat, read the code the agent touched in the **built-in explorer and LSP code viewer**, and run multiple agents **side by side**.

- **Start without an API key** — sign in with your Claude / ChatGPT subscription right in the app and run on it. API-key (pay-as-you-go) billing is available too.
- **Install once** — the app installs and updates the engines (Claude Code · Codex CLI) by itself, and never touches your system-wide terminal setup.
- **Flat dark design on Windows 11 acrylic** — English and Korean UI, switchable in Settings.

## Features

- **Tripo 3D generation** — Settings → Tripo saves your API key, registers the bundled official MCP server, and checks authentication through a balance query. Generate and download assets from Claude/Codex chats. [Setup and validation](docs/tripo.md)
- **ComfyCloud** — Settings → ComfyCloud encrypts your API key and checks MCP tools and credits separately. Claude/Codex chats and balance queries use the same key. [Connection and authentication](docs/comfy-cloud.md)

**Chat · Agents**

- Streaming replies · tool-call logs · approval/question cards (answered ones stay in the thread) · queue messages while a run is going
- **Claude workflows** — multi-agent orchestration runs to completion in the background and posts a wrap-up reply when done. Progress flows live from a pill into a stage/agent board
- **Background residency** — shells (dev servers), subagents, and workflows outlive the turn, and messages sent meanwhile continue in the same session
- Subagent cards — live narration and process logs · background shell tracking (live output, stop, `Ctrl+B` skip)
- Work bar — to-dos · subagents · background shells · changed files · context gauge in one line
- `Ctrl+F` chat search · image/text attachments · `/` commands & skills · `@` file mentions · `↑`/`↓` recall sent messages
- Right-drag **mouse gestures** — scroll, previous/next file, window control, even clearing the chat by hand

**Multi · Extra chats**

- Up to 6 panels working at once, each with its own **folder, model, and account** — inside, it's the main chat verbatim (composer, work bar, approval cards)
- **Extra chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+N`) — an independent OS window to keep beside your code; the conversation persists on close and restores on restart

**Code intelligence**

- Built-in explorer + LSP code viewer — **TS/JS · Python · C# (whole solutions) · C/C++ · Unreal Verse**
- `F12` go-to-definition · semantic coloring (JetBrains palette) · structured hover cards · kind-aware completion icons
- **Korean-translated hovers** for official API docs (Unreal C++ · Verse) · C# assembly symbols decompile on `F12`
- Diff viewer (additions = green rows · deletions = red ghost lines) · **HTML opens straight into a rendered preview** · markdown rendering
- Files the agent touched get colors and badges; right-click a folder → **collected changed files**

## Workflows

Claude Code's **Workflow tool** (multi-agent orchestration) works in the app as-is. Ask it to "audit this whole change with a workflow" and multiple agents work the stages in parallel — and unlike the terminal, the workflow **runs to completion in the background** even after the turn ends, delivering a wrap-up reply on its own.

- The bottom **pill** summarizes progress; press it to unfold the **stage rail + agent board** (per-agent model, tokens, tool counts — live)
- You can **keep chatting** while a workflow runs — it continues in the same session
- **Stop** from the card, tuck it away with `Esc` or the `↓→` gesture — main chat, multi panels, and extra chats alike

## Git

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/git.png" width="900" alt="Built-in Git — changed-file checklist · AI commit message · pull/push" />
</div>

A built-in Git surface for reviewing and shipping what your agents produced — no terminal detour.

- **Changed-file checklist** — check exactly what goes into the commit, click any file to see its diff
- **AI commit message** — one button drafts the message from the staged changes
- Pull / push · history · branch switching and creation
- **Nested repos auto-discovered** (up to 3 levels deep) — monorepo-ish folders each get their own card

## Supported AI Models

| Engine | Models | Billing |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (Anthropic) | Fable 5 · Opus 5 · Sonnet 5 · Haiku 4.5 | Claude subscription (Pro/Max) or API key |
| **Codex CLI** (OpenAI) | GPT-5.6-Sol · GPT-5.6-Terra · GPT-5.6-Luna | ChatGPT subscription (Plus/Pro) or API key |

The model list loads live from the installed engine — when a new model ships, it just appears in the picker. Engine, model, reasoning effort, and permission mode are chosen per chat in the composer.

## Accounts

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/accounts.png" width="900" alt="Settings — Account" />
</div>

Register and manage subscription accounts per engine in Settings → **Account** — keep **several** Anthropic and OpenAI accounts and bind any chat to any of them (unbound chats use the **default** account). Each account shows a **remaining-limit gauge** (5-hour · weekly · Fable) so you can hop to whichever has headroom.

All credentials are stored encrypted (DPAPI) under `~/.agentcodegui`, **fully separated** from your terminal Claude Code (`~/.claude`) and codex (`~/.codex`) logins — neither side affects the other.

## Installation

1. Grab `AgentCodeGUI-Setup-<version>.exe` from [**Releases**](https://github.com/UnrealFactory/AgentCodeGUI/releases/latest) and run it.
2. If SmartScreen warns (the build is unsigned), continue via **"More info → Run anyway"**.
3. Engines install automatically on first launch. Sign in with a subscription account in Settings → **Account** (or add a key in Settings → **API**) and you're off.

- Requirements: **Windows 10/11**
- New versions **auto-update** — when the sidebar badge appears, one click installs quietly.
- Right-click a folder → **"Open with AgentCodeGUI"** to open it as the working folder directly.
